here is how bamazon customer app works

 the BamazonCustomer.js, allows a "customer" to place an order from the Bamazon store. performed on the store inventory and the customer is either alerted that their order cannot be completed, or they are shown the total amount. Behind the scenes, the quantity ordered by the customer is deducted from the store quantity (which is stored in a SQL table). 

 
 this application will first display all of the items available for sale. Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale.

 The app should then prompt users with two messages.

   * The first should ask the user the ID of the product they would like to buy.
   * The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

 Once the customer has placed the order, your application should check if your store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

   * If not, the app should log a phrase like `Insufficient quantity!`, and then prevent the order from going through.

 However, if the store _does_ have enough of the product, the customers should enter lower item quintities snd then resubmit thier order.
